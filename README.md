## Usage:

To test, create a new ``/thing`` coordiante from the following demo:

    roslaunch tf_keyboard_cal tf_keyboard_world_to_thing.launch

Start Rviz and use the TF display to visualize its effect.

    roslaunch tf_keyboard_cal rviz_demo.launch

You can now use the keyboard shorcuts below to move the frame around. **NOTE:** Be sure to have the little black window focused on to recieve keyboard input. Once the TF has been positioned, press `p` to save the settings to the config file. The TF will use these new settings when relaunched.
